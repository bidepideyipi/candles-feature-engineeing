Andrew Ng once pointed out
```text
Figuring out what features to build is difficult, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge. Applied machine learning is basically feature engineering.
```
This fully illustrates its core role in data science projects.

主要流程 Data Preprocessing, Feature Construction / Generation，Feature Selection，Feature Extraction，Dimensionality Reduction

具体技术​ One-hot Encoding、Handling Missing Values、Normalization / Standardization、Binning、Feature Scaling、Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

特征工程太复杂，AI协同还是和吃力，宣告这个项目暂时失败
